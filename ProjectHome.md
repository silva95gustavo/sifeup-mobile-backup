  * Read the detail description of a subject and download the subject's contents
  * See any profile ( student, teacher or employee ) and their schedule
  * Check your printer balance and create a reference to recharge it.
  * Change your password
  * Check your tuition reference and history.
  * See the Lunch menu for the campus canteens.
  * See the park occupation ( ALPHA , it seems that the counter doesn't work that well )
  * See your academic path
  * See the FEUP RSS Feed
  * Upload files to the Samba account
The application is available with English and Portuguese translations.

Why not use the browser?

Because SiFEUP was not meant for mobile devices with small screen, meaning that the interface is based on really small link that are easy to miss when the zoom level is not
extremely high.
